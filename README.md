#Description

API Key: First, i sign up on OpenWeatherMap to get your API key.

Making API Requests:

im Used the requests library to send a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API endpoint.
Handling the Response:

Convert the JSON response into a Python dictionary using response.json().
Extract relevant data such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
Creating Visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn

Data Preparation:

Use pandas to organize the fetched data into a DataFrame for easier manipulation.
Clean and preprocess the data as necessary.
Visualization Techniques:

Scatter Plots: To visualize relationships between variables 
Line Charts: To show trends over time 
Bar Charts: To compare categorical data 
Heatmaps: To visualize correlations between multiple varials

Script: A Python script that fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and processes it.

Visualization Dashboard: A dashboard created using libraries like Dash or Streamlit to display the visualizations interactively, allowing users to select different cities or weather parameters to visualize.

This approach not only helps in understanding weather patterns but also enhances your skills in API integration and data visualization.
